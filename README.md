# Whole Pipeline for Chat Analysis

This project is designed to analyze chat messages using a comprehensive pipeline that includes data cleaning, language detection, tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, gensim, langdetect, nltk, spacy, emoji, re, numpy, ast

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Loading

The notebook begins by loading the chat messages from a CSV file into a list for processing.

### 2. Data Cleaning

The messages are cleaned by removing links, punctuation, numbers, and emojis. The text is also converted to lowercase to standardize it.

### 3. Language Detection

The cleaned messages are analyzed to detect their language. The language of each message is detected, and if more than 50% of the messages are in the same language, that language is considered the dominant language.

### 4. Tokenization

The cleaned text data is tokenized, meaning the text is split into individual words or tokens.

### 5. Stop Words Removal

Stop words (common words that do not carry significant meaning) are removed from the tokenized list to focus on the important words.

### 6. Lemmatization

Lemmatization is performed to reduce words to their base or root form, which helps in normalizing the text data.

### 7. Topic Modeling

The processed text data is used to create a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, which identifies and extracts topics from the messages. The LDA model outputs a set of topics with associated keywords.

### 8. Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is performed on the lemmatized text data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each message. The sentiment scores for each message are then aggregated to find the average sentiment for each identified topic.

### 9. Results

The average sentiment scores for each topic are calculated and printed, providing insights into the overall sentiment associated with each topic.

## Key Functions

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removes unnecessary characters and normalizes text.
2. **Language Detection**: Identifies the primary language of the messages.
3. **Tokenization**: Splits text into tokens for easier processing.
4. **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminates common words that do not contribute to the meaning.
5. **Lemmatization**: Normalizes words to their root form.
6. **Topic Modeling**: Extracts and identifies topics from the text data.
7. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes and scores the sentiment of messages.

## Usage

To use this pipeline, you need to have the required Python libraries installed and have your chat messages in a CSV file. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess your data, perform topic modeling, and analyze the sentiment of your chat messages.
